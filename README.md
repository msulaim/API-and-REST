The **API-and-REST** repository contains the following projects, more details are contained in the READMEs inside each project's directory:

- [ ]**Calendar API**: Create a basic *API* that implements *REST* principles by using *get, post, put and delete* using Python and consume it as well

- [ ]**Crunchbase API**: Consume the *Crunchbase API* to group industries by their functions

- [ ]**gcsa Library**: Gives an overview of the *gcsa library* in Python for consuming the *Google Calendar API*

- [ ]**Google Calendar Event Categorizer**: Events from a user's *Google Calendar* are *grouped* based on the *categories specified by the user* through which the user is informed where and how much time they are spending. The *Google Calendar API* is consumed using the *gcsa* library in Python, the events from the user's calendar are stored in a *DataFrame* along with useful data related to the *start* and *end* time as well as *duration*. The results are then plotted in the form of pie, horizontal bar, stacked bar chart informing the user of the ***"% Time Spent by Category", "Average Time Spent Per Category", "Average Time Spent Per Category by Day of Week", "Total Time Spent Per Calendar"***
