'''
->Purpose: 
The following program groups events from a user's Google Calendar based on categories specified by
the user in a .yaml file. The .yaml file contains the user's configurations such as the categories,
which calendar to use, email addresses and Calendar IDs
'''

'''
->Imports:
  yaml: to load yaml file provided by the user
  gcsa: Google Calendar Simple API or gcsa is a library that simplifies event management
         in a Google calendar, it is a Python oreinted adapter for the official Google Calendar API.
         We intend to make use of the 
             GoogleCalendar, object: for authentication, 
             get_events(), method: to get all events in a time-frame from the user's specified calendar
  
  beautiful_date: module that can be used for formatting dates 
  
  datetime: module useful for finding duration between two dates
  
  pandas: used to create DataFrames, which is our data strcuture for storing data
